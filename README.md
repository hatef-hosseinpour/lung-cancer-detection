# lung-cancer-detection
**Lung cancer** is the leading cause of death in women and men with cancer. Some of the treatment methods used in the treatment of lung cancer include these items; Surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy. The role of machine learning in cancer research offers several advantages, primarily increasing information processing and increasing the accuracy of clinical decision making.

In this project, an attempt has been made to check the possibility of lung cancer by using machine learning. In this web application, questions are asked to the user about the symptoms of this disease, and by checking the user's answers, the probability of his disease is predicted.

The dataset used in this project can be accessed from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/h13380436001/h-lung-cancer).

- The frontend design of the site is JavaScript, Bootstrap v5.1.3, CSS3, HTML5.
- The backend of the site is done using the Python programming language and the Flask framework

**VotingClassifier** is used in this project, A voting classifier is a machine learning estimator that trains various base models or estimators and predicts on the basis of aggregating the findings of each base estimator
